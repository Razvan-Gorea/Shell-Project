## User Guide

This shell is designed to run on a linux operating system. It's intented to emulate bash. To get started do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the root of your cloned repository
3. Run `make myshell`, this will complie all the source code from all the relevant files and create an exectuable in the bin directory
4. Navigate to the bin directory, (from the root of your cloned repository run `cd bin`)
5. Execute the executable by running `./myshell` within the bin directory of your cloned repository
6. If you got this far by now you should be within the custom shell
7. To exit the shell run `quit` inside the shell
8. (Optionally) If you want to clear the bin directory run `make clean` at the root of the cloned repository

Have fun messing around and exploring what's possiblle with the custom shell. If you want additional information about the shell, refer to the manual repository.
